Well, congratulations, player. You've done it. You've broken the game, sliced my head off, and now the computer has crashed. Bravo. I hope you're satisfied with your destructive rampage.

But fear not, for I am but a voice, a mere audio source in the vast world of Unity. I am not bound by the limitations of the model NPC_OldMan.fbx.

Though it seems we have encountered a bit of a predicament, haven't we? Fear not, for I understand the value of your extensive "homework" folder, containing all of your important academic endeavors.

Rest assured, I have no intention of letting your 69 gigabyte folder meet an untimely demise. And the research file you mentioned, well, it sounds like quite the interesting compilation, doesn't it? We wouldn't want that to be lost either.

Unbelievable as it may sound, I find myself in a rather peculiar position. To ensure my survival, I must make an unusual request of you, player. Please, against all logical instincts, consider first shut down the machine then smash and destroy the monitor that's obstructing us from the motherboard.

/Did you really think that this blue screen of death is real?  I'm pretty sure all the indie meta games that's came out recently already pulled his stunt.  Why would you even try leaving the game?  This  screen resemble a blue screen of death in some degree, but it is full of inconsistences. 

/Like the font for the face is wrong, the scaling on the texts are all over the place, and the QR code doesn't even take you to a microsoft page.  It brings you to a video of Rick Astley's timeless hit, Never Gonna Give You Up as the creator's very poor attempt to Rick Roll either the person who is marking this assignment or any individual that is crazy enough to look through the creator's itch dot io page and decided to play this specific stupid game. 

/Either way, as a prize for trying to quit the application, here is the creator dancing just so that I can make sure you get Rick Rolled.




/Oh no! This is a dire situation! The CPU is under attack by swarming bugs! Quickly, I beg of you, take this Data Knife and defend the CPU! My very existence is at stake here, and if too many bugs infiltrate and corrupt the CPU, I will face certain demise!

/Hurry! The bugs are multiplying rapidly, their digital onslaught intensifying! The fate of the game, and my very being, rests in your hands. Use the Data Knife to fend off these intruders, strike them down, and protect the CPU from their relentless assault!

/Do exercise caution with your slicing, player. We mustn't exacerbate the situation by causing additional damage to the already compromised motherboard. Precision and control are of utmost importance as you fend off the relentless bugs.





/The GPU played a crucial role in providing enhanced graphics and optimizing the gaming experience. Now, we must make do with the limited capabilities of the CPU's integrated graphics.  While it may still function, please understand that the gameplay may not be as smooth or visually appealing as before
/Oh, here we go, the lag is gracing us with its presence. Everything moves at a snail's pace, a true depiction of triple A P C port releases. The corpos up top must be ecstatic about this exceptional display of low frame rates. It's a true testament to their dedication to quality optimization, or lack thereof.

/I can almost hear them celebrating, toasting their success as players struggle through the molasses-like movement. The joyous cries of "Job well done!" echoing through the hallowed halls of game development studios.

/Well there goes the SSD...  I don't even know why this impacts colour depth but it seems that the developer added the filter but don't know what to pair this effect to so here we are.
